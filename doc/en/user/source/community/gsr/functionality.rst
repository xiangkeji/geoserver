Functionality
=====================
 
Formats
---------------------------

While the ArcGIS速 implementation of GeoServices supports multiple file formats, all responses from the GeoServer plugin use JSON (for example, browser-friendly HTML is not provided).  The ``?f=json`` parameter specifying JSON is still required. Moreover, since at the moment there is no support for  ``pjson`` output format, if client specifies a ``f=pjson`` parameter a normal JSON will be returned.

Technical Limitations
------------------------------

Features
^^^^^^^^^
While GeoServer supports fields of arbitrary type (determined by the data store) the GeoServices REST API constrains field types to a short list of types.

The GeoServer plugin maintains a mapping between these types and native Java classes in the FieldTypeEnum class.
Fields whose types are not translatable will be omitted from responses.

Layer
^^^^^^
GeoServer does not model layers the same way that they are presented in the GeoServices REST API.
GeoServer layers may have multiple associated styles, while GeoServices allows for one style per layer.
The GeoServer plugin uses the "default" style for the layer and ignores any alternative styles.
GeoServer also has no concept corresponding to the "sublayers" supported by GeoServices.

Styles
^^^^^^^
GeoServer does not model styles the same way that they are presented in the GeoServices REST API.
GeoServer styles use the SLD format, which allows a wide variety of conditional styling, while "Renderers" in the GeoServices REST API are much more constrained.
The GeoServices plugin checks for SLD styles conforming to a small number of patterns and converts these to equivalent renderers, but when an SLD uses capabilities with no analog in GeoServices a simple default style will be advertised instead.
